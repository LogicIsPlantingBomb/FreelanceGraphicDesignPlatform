# Freelance Graphic Design Platform

## Project Title
Soroban Freelance Graphic Design Marketplace

## Project Description
This project implements a decentralized freelance graphic design marketplace on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. The platform enables clients to hire graphic designers for various design projects, creating a trustless environment where both parties can transact with confidence.

The smart contract manages the project lifecycle, from creation to completion, handling the relationship between clients and designers while maintaining transparency and security throughout the process.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the freelance graphic design industry by removing intermediaries and creating a global, permissionless marketplace where designers can connect directly with clients. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:

1. Reduce fees associated with traditional freelance platforms
2. Eliminate payment processing delays and international transaction barriers
3. Create immutable records of work agreements and completed projects
4. Build reputation systems based on verifiable on-chain history
5. Enable fair dispute resolution mechanisms

## Key Features
The current implementation includes these core features:

1. **Project Creation**: Clients can create design projects, specifying requirements, budget, and timeline.
2. **Project Tracking**: Both clients and designers can monitor project status and progression through defined stages.
3. **Status Management**: Projects move through various states (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Disputed) with appropriate triggers and permissions.
4. **Transparent History**: All project interactions are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable history.

## ScreenShots


The smart contract specifically provides:

- `create_project`: Function for clients to create new design projects and assign them to designers
- `update_project_status`: Function to update the status of a project as it progresses
- `get_project`: Function to retrieve project details for any registered project

## Future Scope
Future development will focus on enhancing the platform with additional features:

1. **Escrow System**: Implementation of a secure payment escrow system to protect both clients and designers.
2. **Multi-stage Payments**: Support for milestone-based payments for larger projects.
3. **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**: A community-governed process for resolving disputes between clients and designers.
4. **Reputation System**: On-chain reputation tracking for both clients and designers.
5. **Portfolio Showcase**: Ability for designers to showcase completed projects as verifiable portfolio entries.
6. **Design NFTs**: Option to mint completed designs as NFTs with appropriate rights transfer.
7. **DAO Governance**: Community governance mechanism for platform parameters and dispute resolution.
8. **Specialized Design Categories**: Support for various design disciplines with customized project templates.
9. **Collaborative Design Projects**: Enable multiple designers to work on large projects.
10. **Integration with Decentralized Identity**: Connect designer profiles with decentralized identity solutions.

By building on the Stellar blockchain with Soroban, this platform aims to create a truly global, accessible marketplace for graphic design talent that operates with minimal friction and maximum trust.
