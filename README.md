- **Request Service**: Clients can submit a service request against a listed design service.
- **View Request Status**: Designers can check the status of received requests.

## Future Scope
- Integrate payment settlement in Stellar Lumens (XLM) through escrow mechanism.
- Add rating and review features to build designer reputations.
- Expand to support other creative freelancing categories (illustrators, video editors, etc.).
- Build front-end DApp with wallet connection and user-friendly UI.
- Enable dispute resolution through community governance.
